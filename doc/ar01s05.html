    that allows to use Rich Booleans in 128 different assertion macros. The assertions can optionally have expressions that
    are shown in case of a failure, a level, a group, and an action to be taken. Failing assertions are passed to
    loggers and a displayer object that asks the user what to do. The loggers and the displayer object
    can be set at runtime by the application. You can associate filters with loggers and the displayer,
	so you can filter out assertions on several criteria. Two dialogs are provided to show
    the Rich Boolean and the expressions, one for Win32 and one for wxWidgets.
	There is also code to display the Rich Boolean and the expressions in command line applications.
	Several loggers are provided that log to a stream, or to the trace window in Win32 applications.
    For Rich Booleans version 2.2.2, you need at least ModAssert version 1.3. Note: the examples in
    this document use the macro <code class="code">MOD_ASSERT</code> from the ModAssert package.

    developed by Q-Mentum. Its assertions can use Rich Booleans. The assertions can
	optionally have expressions that are shown in case of a failure. They stop the test after
	a failure, but there are variations that continue after a failure, so assertions after it
	are still evaluated. If the evaluation of the condition in an assertion causes problems,
	the assertion can be modified so it is ignored, which causes 
	a warning to remind the developer of the ignored assertion.</p><p>These eight variations of the assertion macro are made possible by using Rich Booleans,
	because they allow the assertion macros to vary in their behaviour, and leave
	the analysis to the Rich Boolean (just as with the assertions in ModAssert).</p><p>UquoniTest has other features like: automatic registering of tests, easy fixture tests,
	parameterized and template tests, integration with assertions in domain code,
	easy abstract tests (including multiple abstraction levels and multiple inheritance),
	create test directories (optionally prefilled with files and directories),
	an extensive mock library,
	static and dynamic testsuites, custom testlisteners and testwrappers, orthodoxy testing,
	timeouts on tests, test time measured up to microseconds, and more.
	Unlike some other unit testing packages for C++, UquoniTest allows you to place
	breakpoints in test code.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Support </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Requirements</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
